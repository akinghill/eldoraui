<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Gatsby project using `create-gatsby`:

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

### Configure your Gatsby project to use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

You will be asked a few questions to configure your project:

```txt showLineNumbers
✔ What would you like to call your site?
· your-app-name
✔ What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created?
· your-app-name
✔ Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript?
· TypeScript
✔ Will you be using a CMS?
· Choose whatever you want
✔ Would you like to install a styling system?
· Tailwind CSS
✔ Would you like to install additional features with other plugins?
· Choose whatever you want
✔ Shall we do this? (Y/n) · Yes
```

### Edit tsconfig.json file

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.json` file to resolve paths:

```ts {4-9} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": [
        "./src/*"
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Create gatsby-node.ts file

Create a `gatsby-node.ts` file at the root of your project if it doesn’t already exist, and add the code below to the `gatsby-node` file so your app can resolve paths:

```ts
import * as path from "path";

export const onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        "@/components": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/components"),
        "@/lib/utils": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/lib/utils"),
      },
    },
  });
};
```

### Follow the Steps

Follow the steps and install dependencies and copy paste code of the components

### Add Utils file

```typescript
import { ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.
